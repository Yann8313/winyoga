  <p>Checkmate... Did he just throw my cat out of the window? You really think you can fly that thing? Life finds a way. We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!</p>
  <p>This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows. God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? Life finds a way.</p>
